## Breakdown/ What we are learning?

1. Start by creating the repo
2. Clone the repo from github to the local computer of which you are working on
3. Create the HTML file for the document to begin the lesson
4. Start the lesson with learning the proper structure of HTML

5. Format the html document so that we can begin creating the structure of our document
6. Begin filling our page with the content, start with the title tag, next use the h1 tag to start our structure
7. Get the understanding of how the h1 through h6 headings all work
8. Learn how to create the paragraph tag and how we can use multiple

9. Now we will learn how to apply images within the file
10. We have saved two images to link within our document
11. Create a second folder within the assets folder, name that folder images
12. From the file that we extracted with the content for this course we will copy the two images
13. Then we will save both images into the new folder 'images' that we have created within our project folder

14. We will now use the img tag to create the accessibility for the images that we would like to display in the file
15. We will also have to use the attribute to call on the specific photo/ image that we want to use, that attribute is the src attribute
16. Once we have fully structured our tag/ element for the images we can save the changes and view them in the browser
17. Create the src and alt attributes so that we can call on the image and give the image meaning
18. Remember that the image tag is a self closing tag, meaning that this is a single tag element

19. Now we will learn how to use links within our html file
20. We will use the a tag which is known as the anchor tag and then we will use the href attribute
21. Creat the link to the udemy website using the a tag and the proper attribute
22. Remember that the href is hyper reference, that we are calling upon which means that we will need the https url to link to
23. We must place text or content between the opening and the closing anchor tag so that the user has something to click on

24. Learn the target attribute which will open a new tab or window if we would like to do so with our links

28. Take a quiz to finalize the section to show what we have learned along the way

29. Now we begin with the basics of css styling
30. Understanding all the ways that we can style an html file with the css property and value selectors
31. In our case we will use the external style sheet option, this is my favorite way to do so
32. Now we must create the link for our style sheet that we are trying to call upon for our html file
33. Complete the creation of our link for the css style sheet, create one file style to see that the link works as it should

34. Now we will begin to learn how to structure the css file to assign properties and values by each selector
35. Start by creating some styles for the html, we will start with the element selectors
36. We have now created styles for the body and for the h1 and h2 elements
37. We will now create the styles for the paragraph elements and work on condensing the css file
38. Now we will condense the css styles using the css inheritance rule

39. Learning how to style with colors, multiple ways to access the color schemes
40. Learning how to style with the class selector and the id selector
41. We will start with styling in the html by using the attribute of class within the paragraph tag
42. Next, we will use the styling in the html by using the attribute of id within the paragraph tag
43. Begin the styling the class and the id within the style sheet

44. Remember that ids are suppose to be very unique, they are to only be used once
45. CLasses are the best practice because the class can be applied more than once

57. Comment around all div containers to format properly
58. Begin styling each div container to show each box, better understanding of what we have done
59. Learning how to use the width of a container
60. Learning how to use the float property to move things around on the web page
61. Float two selectors and test that the floats have worked pushing the specified content in that direction

62. Learn how to use the clear property, which is like the counter part to the float property
63. Using the clear property within a psuedo selector. placing the div after the div with class of other-posts
