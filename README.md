## Breakdown/ What we are learning?

1. Start by creating the repo
2. Clone the repo from github to the local computer of which you are working on
3. Create the HTML file for the document to begin the lesson
4. Start the lesson with learning the proper structure of HTML

5. Format the html document so that we can begin creating the structure of our document
6. Begin filling our page with the content, start with the title tag, next use the h1 tag to start our structure
7. Get the understanding of how the h1 through h6 headings all work
8. Learn how to create the paragraph tag and how we can use multiple

9. Now we will learn how to apply images within the file
10. We have saved two images to link within our document
11. Create a second folder within the assets folder, name that folder images
12. From the file that we extracted with the content for this course we will copy the two images
13. Then we will save both images into the new folder 'images' that we have created within our project folder

14. We will now use the img tag to create the accessibility for the images that we would like to display in the file
15. We will also have to use the attribute to call on the specific photo/ image that we want to use, that attribute is the src attribute
16. Once we have fully structured our tag/ element for the images we can save the changes and view them in the browser
17. Create the src and alt attributes so that we can call on the image and give the image meaning
18. Remember that the image tag is a self closing tag, meaning that this is a single tag element

19. Now we will learn how to use links within our html file
20. We will use the a tag which is known as the anchor tag and then we will use the href attribute
21. Creat the link to the udemy website using the a tag and the proper attribute
22. Remember that the href is hyper reference, that we are calling upon which means that we will need the https url to link to
23. We must place text or content between the opening and the closing anchor tag so that the user has something to click on

24. Learn the target attribute which will open a new tab or window if we would like to do so with our links
25. To make these links open in a new tab we can use the target="_blank"
26. We have learned how to link an external file or document now lets try doing this with internal link of the page/ file
27. Complete the HTML introduction to the basics course content
28. Take a quiz to finalize the section to show what we have learned along the way
